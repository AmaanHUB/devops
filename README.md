## Why Use DevOps? - Benefits To The Business

DevOps bridges the gap between the historically isolated development and operations teams. Some benefits to the business are shown below:

* Shorter development cycles
*  Reduce implementation failures, reflections and recovery time
*  Better communication and cooperation between teams
*  Reduce Costs

## Tools Of DevOps

* Configuration Management:
	* Ansible
	* Puppet
	* Chef
* Monitoring:
	* Grafana
	* Prometheus
	* Nagios
* Cloud computing:
	* AWS SSS, EC2 etc.
	* GCP
	* DigitalOcean Droplets
	* Hetzner

## Cloud Computing

## SAAS, PAAS, And IAAS

* SAAS (Software as a Service):
	* Form of cloud computing that delivers a cloud application, with all its underlying IT infrastructure and platforms to users. Service provider manages application all the way to the O/S and networking.
* IAAS (Infrastructure as a Service):
	* Provides virtualisation, storage, network and servers. One can essentially rent all of this so that the customer doesn't have to worry about setting up their in infrastructure.
* PAAS (Platform as a Service):
	* Essentially same as IAAS the service provider manages everything but data and applications.


See image below to understand the differences between them.

### When Should We Use Each Of Them?

One of the main differences as to why you would want to use each type of 'as a service' depends on how much control one wants (see above image), thus catering towards different use cases. For example, IaaS avoids the complexity and expense of buying and managing one's own physical servers and other data centre infrastructure, and allows one to only rent what one needs which could be especially useful for businesses starting up.


SaaS  allows users to connnext to and use cloud-based apps over the internet, such as email and office tools (such as in Microsoft Office 365). Essentially a pay-as-you-go basis again, with all the underlying infrastructure, middleware, app software and app data are located in the service provider's data centre.

PaaS is just like IaaS, but include all middleware, development tools, data management and more. It is designed to support the complete web application life cycle: building, deploying, managing, and updating. Avoids the expense and complexity of buying and managing everything!

## On Premises, Hybrid and Public Clouds

* On Premises:
	* Server is on their own property
* Hybrid:
	* A mixture of on premises and in the public cloud .e.g. using servers on premises for crunching high intensity calculations, with an instance in the public cloud on AWS as a back up for data
* Public Cloud:
	* A 'server' that you can rent time and space on, everything is on it .e.g. AWS
