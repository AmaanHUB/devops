### When Should We Use Each Of Them?


## On Premises, Hybrid and Public Clouds

* On Premises:
	* Server is on their own property
* Hybrid:
	* A mixture of on premises and in the public cloud .e.g. using servers on premises for crunching high intensity calculations, with an instance in the public cloud on AWS as a back up for data
* Public Cloud:
	* A 'server' that you can rent time and space on, everything is on this.
